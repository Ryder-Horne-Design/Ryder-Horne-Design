Sabercat Robotics needed a website that would be customizable, optimized for search engines, and have a good user experience. Therefore, they turned to our agency and asked for our help in developing a new website.",

While this website was functional, it was not optimized for search engines, had a poor design, and had features that the team at Sisters in STEM did not need or want. GoDaddy's website builder also charged the organization an annual fee that took away from the organization's ability to host events they wanted and spread their message. Sisters in STEM was looking for a new website that would be fit to their liking, meaning good SEO, good design, and only the features they absolutely wanted and needed, while also not costing them hundreds of dollars per year. This led to them turning to our agency and asking for our help in developing a new website that envisioned who Sisters in STEM was, and what they did.",
        "solution": "Our agency worked with Sisters in STEM to help them optimize their new website for search engines and optimize their new website's design and user experience. We also helped Sisters in STEM set up necessary SEO and analytics tools, such as Google Search Console. This allowed for Sisters in STEM to gain more traction on their new website and analyze this traction to make sure their website was up and working. Because this website had a good design and the features the team needed, Sisters in STEM saw many more contacts and visitors to their website."
